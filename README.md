# Educational-Keylogger-Using-Python
## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an **Educational Keylogger** developed using **Python and Tkinter**.  
The application records keyboard inputs **only within the application window** and stores them in a text file for learning purposes.  
It does **not run in the background** and follows ethical guidelines with user awareness.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Understanding how keyboard inputs are captured is important for learning GUI event handling, user interaction analysis, and basic cybersecurity concepts.  
This project provides a simple and ethical way to demonstrate keystroke logging in a controlled environment.

## 📝 Project Description
The Educational Keylogger captures keystrokes typed inside a Tkinter-based graphical interface.  
Each key press is logged along with a timestamp and saved in a text file (`keystrokes.txt`).  
The project is intended **strictly for educational purposes** and ensures user consent and privacy.

## 👥 End Users
- Students learning Python
- Beginners in cybersecurity
- Educators teaching event handling
